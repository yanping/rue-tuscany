This site used to be hosted on [HostingRails](http://hostingrails.com/), and have since used two different domain names: rosebery.ca, miffytrail.com. The main reason for recent domain name switches was simply because I did not find the name truly resonated with me. I wish I could have used my full name, but that will be utterly impossible, given how many Jennifer Lee(s) are out there... Hence, a blog redesign, and the name 'rue-tuscany' a.k.a 'Train of Thoughts to Tuscany'.

I have experienced difficulty in keeping up a regular blog, so my apology to those who stopped by this site last year. Blogging at least once per week would be the most to expect for now. But again, don't take my words for it. My cognitive ability has somewhat decreased since my graduate courses were completed over a year ago. Thinking that I could focus solely on my master thesis, and therefore postponed looking for jobs does not really work out for me. Perhaps it's time to admit I no longer have the capacity to engage in research intensive types of project, or that I failed to be passionate enough in what I'm doing. Taking that into account, it will be reasonable to save money for the hosting. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) came in just at the right time to host this site for free. A very good explanation on how to set it up to work with Jekyll can be found at this [blog post](http://datamangling.com/2010/07/Jekyll-on-Heroku).

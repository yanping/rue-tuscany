*`Two activities: one at the beginning, one at the end.` -- Pema Chodron --*

> In the morning when you wake up, you reflect on the day ahead and aspire to use it to keep a wide-open heart and mind. At the end of the day, before going to sleep, you think over what you have done. If you fulfilled your aspiration, even once, rejoice in that. If you went against your aspiration, rejoice that you are able to see what you did and are no longer living in ignorance. This way you will be inspired to go forward with increasing clarity, confidence, and compassion in the days that follow.

Spring is too short to miss out. We experience a slightly late and cold Spring this year with a lot of precipitation. Today and last Thursday, I managed to pick up my camera again. I am very happy to have captured those little things in our backyard. The annual Tulip Festival has started. I'm not sure if I will be able to go and see the flowers this year. I have been trying to set a deadline as late as the end of June to submit my thesis. At the same time, I need to ask myself how realistic this goal is.

I have been thinking of what it means to be really happy. Feeling as if I have been pursuing the so-called happiness relentlessly. My plans are not always carried out with full consideration beforehand, which often makes me feel guilty for failing to adhere to certain norms I set for myself. Just to be happy, I'm always willing to invest in anything within my capabilities whenever deemed appropriate. This includes the monetary route as well, such as buying things and services to meet my curiosity and experimental nature. The later is more for having someone to talk to, or simply for developing a friendship. 

The kind of happiness obtained in such manners will not last forever. Buying physical things often falls short of our expectation, and we wake up feeling more disappointed than before. The road to happiness always foresees several wrong choices, which unfortunately are needed in order to make better-informed decision in the future. This article from [Psyblog, Six Psychological Reasons Consumer Culture is Unsatisfying] (http://www.spring.org.uk/2010/04/six-psychological-reasons-consumer-culture-is-unsatisfying.php) gives a nice insight to the overall implications. 

I am still going to get things I need. Only that there is this growing tendency to think twice before purchasing things that look only attractive, but do not contain any significant values or long term benefits. I appreciate beautiful clothes. However, past lessons have taught me that I only need to replace clothes that have almost worn out. These are my favorite T-shirts, pants, or jeans, which I am happy enough to wear in different colors daily, or in slightly different styles interchangably. I used to be an avid snacker, but my health has gotten more sensitive to these food recently. I am cutting back of the amount. It will be too bad if my time is spent falling sick again from cough, throat infection, or stomach flu. These food already contain little or no nutrients. In some cases, they lead to obesity too. 

Whenever I shop now, I know exactly what I need. It helps to get myself out of the stores as soon as my chores are done. All of these are simply life changes evident on the material level. On a higher level, things have never been the same since the post break-up from a four years relationship, which also happened to be my first. It has been a year and a half today without any news whatsoever. It was hard at first, but time has been my best friend. Holding no grudges, no bitterness. Does every break-up always have to lead to awkwardness, hiding, always thinking the other person is never going to be forgiving? If that is really the case, it is such a pity.

While I'm progressing in some aspects, I have to admit my life is not as productive as what I want it to be at this moment. It feels rather empty or blend. Last year, I started to experience a symptom of withdrawal. I guess there are some side effects from always trying to find ways to heal ourselves. That's why psychologists are there for us. Nevertheless, I still believe [the best cure is ourselves](http://fengshuiforward.com/330/the-most-powerful-cure-ourselves/). The side effects I meant are the inferiority complex, analysis-paralysis, and [impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) that I recently find myself struggling with. I think I am going to have a big trouble awaiting if I let this procrastination habit continues. I am so close to finishing my master degree, and it is just happening at this time of the year. 

On the positive note, I have this new appreciation of being related to others. I learned the hard way the need to cherish love and true friendships, for we never know what we have until it is taken away from us. It will take some time to rebuild my connections again. And I realise it is not going to be easy, as I still find myself thinking twice as much before I act or speak. First, I need to let go of the fear or paranoia of not being liked by others at the very beginning of a friendship. I feel I have been very unfair to those whom I met briefly at graduate school. They are nice people too.

Before deleting my Facebook account, I spent a lot of time liking other people's posts, looking through their pictures and comments. I did that because I really found their stuff nice and interesting. At the same time, I also realise it is very important for everyone of us to receive any kind of appreciation or praises once in a while. There is nothing wrong if we can make someone's day better. I really do not mind doing that even though my own stuff on FB do not usually receive similar kind of interests. However, the more I do that, I will then ask myself why I have nothing better to do, or why there is such a serious lack of love and passion in my life. This has been unexpected. How easy this is turning against myself soon, and I did that a lot everyday. I think I can be very unreasonable and lacking of self control sometimes. As my number of friends are growing to more than 250, I also find the news streams are getting way too much noise. 

I have 13 more days to go before my account is completely deleted by Facebook. It was not an easy decision even though I had spent considerable amount of time weighing the pros and cons. I have very few good friends on Facebook who uses the messaging system to keep in touch with me. There are also friends I made through Fluff Friends who can be very supportive at times. The biggest cons is clearly the fact that [Facebook is eroding our privacy as time goes] (http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline). The way they do it is getting more tricky, and we as users do not have as much authority anymore. We are viewed only as their product that has a lot of valuable data to contribute in their effort to dominate the web. 

There are many who are not concerned about their privacy. But there are also those who care, and decide to just share information that is not private. They have thoroughly gone through their privacy settings. I was doing the same just before this. But I dislike Facebook's latest policy after constantly finding myself readjust the privacy settings. I also need to get away for one particular reason I stated previously. Take for example, today I haven't used it at all, and it's a good thing I haven't missed everything going on there. Even better, if tomorrow and the days after, I will no longer think about signing in. But I still think about friends who suddenly couldn't contact me. Still, I believe the majority will not notice or care much about it. These people already have about 500 to 2000 friends.

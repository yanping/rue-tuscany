Growing up until my journey just before entering post-secondary education, I have to admit that I was not aware of any women in the field of computing who would inspire me. In spite of performing well in nearly all subjects during my school years , with the exception of sports, I had not the slightest inkling of my true passion -- what I wanted to study when applying to university, and and what I would love to do upon graduation. So I went on to major in double degrees in Information Technology and Applied Mathematics. Information Technology was the most popular major among my peers during the dot com eras in early 2000s, and it was considered much more affordable and time efficient than if I had studied to become a doctor.

The first two years of my study had not been easy. Practical programming instructions in C and C++ were given by teaching assistants at fast pace, accompanied by minimal theory and background in data structure taught in the classroom. I soon discovered that I was falling behind. I realized the difficulty is partly due to the fact that I was never exposed to programming early on in life. Nevertheless, I haven't regretted my decision to this day. I decided to start my Computer Science education anew in Canada in 2002. The following years were again frought with failures and difficulties. But I have since discovered so many possibilities of what I can do with my study, and how the nature of computing is interdisciplinary. Along the way, I have known wonderful women with true passion and enthusiasm in what they do, and ones that endlessly contribute to empower many more women to embark in the study of technology, science and engineering. 

In honour of [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), here is my list of women to follow on Twitter: [@catehstn](http://twitter.com/catehstn); [@hmason](http://twitter.com/hmason); [@gailcarmichael](http://twitter.com/gailcarmichael); [@terriko](http://twitter.com/terriko); [@ashalynd](http://twitter.com/ashalynd); [@FayeWilliams](http://twitter.com/FayeWilliams); [@jenndox](http://twitter.com/jenndox); [@missmcj](http://twitter.com/missmcj).

It is now 2.57 am, and I am still figuring out some stuff for Monday. During my search today, I came across this beautiful customized logo from Google. I just realized it was already Mother's Day. It had been cloudy and rainy yesterday. I hope the day will soon brighthen up a bit for this occasion.

I heard about Mother's Day from my little cousin just a few days ago, but I forgot when the day actually came. How sweet she was when she said my little teddy bear would have loved to prepare a gift for me, but it was unable to (as I have been like the teddy's mum). So on behalf of the teddy, she made a drawing for me. Thank you to both ^_^.

I would also like to wish all the mothers in this world, a Happy Mother's Day. Thank you for all the love you have given to us.

With love,

I was overjoyed when my niece was born last year. We had been waiting for months, and our wish was fulfilled exactly on Sunday, October 10, 2010. She is a 7 month old baby now, and she looks healthy and active. I let my mother and grandmother know about my intention of becoming a godmother for my niece. They quickly laughed it off, explaining the responsibilities I had to bear in that case. Actually, I don't think it is such a bad idea, because I am not sure if I will be able to have a family of my own one day. Considering my status of being a student, I am obviously not ready to be a godmother -- not when I'm economically incapable. Regardless, I will revisit this idea again in the near future :-). She is just so adorable ^_^. Prior to this, I even considered sponsoring a child!

On a related note, I just found out that my grandmother was admitted to hospital, and it is still unclear to me when that happened. She was still home when I talked to her four days ago. She did tell me about the partial numbness felt in her right palm and the sole of her feet for the first time last Saturday. I managed to get hold of my sister online yesterday. We were too excited about her baby on the webcam that I forgot to inquiry more details of my grandmother. I was looking forward to talk to my grandmother later in the evening, however, she was not available. So I called home and found out that she was still in the hospital. Based on the brief description from my sister, the doctor was uncertain of the right treatment as her blood pressure changed rapidly. They had to observe her condition every two hours to find out whether a given treatment was effective. I will suggest my sister to get a second opinion whenever possible. 

This incident serves to remind me that I really don't have much time left. I would like to go back to Jakarta after defending my thesis. By next week, I hope I can have everything planned out for my thesis and write a report to my advisor who's going to be away for that week. And by the end of May, preferably, I need to have some results that can be analyzed, so that when my advisor is gone for the whole June, I can spend time to write and wrap up my thesis. I may not be able to submit my thesis by the end of June, but at least I have something working and part of the writing that I can slowly build up. 

It has been a little more than 3 months since I arrived back in Canada. I had to return to Jakarta in mid August last year when my grandfather passed away. It had never come across my mind to come home in such manner. It was a very sudden event which none of us could foresee. Just a week before, he came back from a family reunion (from Taiwan and Bali) for which I was unable to join. He must have been exhausted and deprieved of good rest. I stayed with my grandmother for almost six months from that moment on. I have been so paralyzed with regards to my thesis. Perhaps I should have given it up a long time ago had I known that it doesn't matter how much time I have, I still find enormous amount of internal barrier to get it done... On the other hand, my grandfather would have loved to see me finishing my thesis. I think I shall finish it for him, my family who has been supporting me all these time, and also for advisor and myself.

  <b>This teddy is a gift from my grandparents when I was 8 years old in the 1990. She has been my loyal companion. It's funny how my grandfather supported me to bring the teddy -- twice during my move to live with my parents and to Canada -- even though grandma didn't think it was a good idea :-).</b>

I thought a whole lot of what could have been last week -- like how I should have tried to earn sufficient work experience in Canada before going home for good. I wasted so many years in school which could have been spent working and gathering points to apply for permanent residency. Had I not been always undecided, a citizenship might have been a reality right now. That has never been my main priority, but it would have made it so much easier to visit other countries and be respected a little more when you enter another country (at least they won't have to stop you for the luggage). This sounds like the Law of Sunk Cost...

There is no way back and I am not getting younger to fix things. People say it is always difficult to start over. I find it so true. Reiterating my focus again, they should be: 1) To go home to accompany grandmother once I'm done here. 2) Regardless of whether I can find a related job to my field, there's always a way out. I can help my brother on the software side to run my mother's restaurant (he may not need to pay someone else to do that anymore). At the same time, I can keep learning on my own, enter some challenge, contribute to Open Source Project, and hopefully be eligible to participate in Google Summer of Code. 

The near future is hard to tell, and there will be many variables that come into the picture. Hence, while trying to prioritize the above things, it's better to aim for small things at once and see where they lead to. I have been constantly worried of my grandmother since I left home, and I often feel so running out of time. Let's hope for the best...

Wrapping up, I am going to briefly touch on the food of the week. I have found that avocados, strawberries, 12 Grain or Ancient Grain Wheat Bread, with or without microwaved egg and any cheese are perfect choice for easy breakfast/brunch, or snack. In fact, they are healthy combination and good for anytime. Avocados and strawberries are generally expensive here. Nonetheless, since crackers, chips/tortillas and instant soup are not well suited for my needs and health (due to the amount of sodium and dryness, and even though they claim to contain Omega 3 and fibers), it is alright to spend more on the fruits and wheat bread instead. Below are snapshots of what I had this afternoon with Ceylon Jasmine Green Tea. The cheese is Jarlsberg imported from Norway, which is quite similar to Swiss cheese. The unpeeled avocado and strawberries inside the container are left overs I saved for another day.

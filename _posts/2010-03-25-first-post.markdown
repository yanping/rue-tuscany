excerpt: The whole process of learning Github and Jekyll has been worthwhile.

It was nice learning about [github pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages) and [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  I'm still not quite done, but at least we have the basics for now. The [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) language seems to be a very logical way for writing posts. It is wonderful in a way that it allows us to focus better on the content.

During the process, I tested out this blog with a few different browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer (IE) 8, Chrome, and Opera. Getting it to work with Firefox was not so straightforward. For example, how could a Firefox browser possibly give us an IE 6 warning about missing plugin while the browser is obviously not IE. It was only later that I figured out that it had something to do with the default layout. Including the Google Analytic codes eliminated the warning. I still don't understand because the error message was kind of misleading. I was relieved that it did not take me too long to narrow down to this. It usually takes me more time on similar issues.

I initially wanted to host the blog on Github pages for free. But with only a 0.3GB storage, I'm afraid it won't last long to accomadate my writing and files overtime. I also thought it would be nice to give a more personalized home to this website. So I registered for a web hosting, but was initially confused by thinking that it included domain name. Fortunately, the forum gave enough information to realize that a domain registrar was still missing (ended up paying for both. But it is not much and only yearly for the domain name). Once the nameservers were updated to point to HostingRails DNS servers from a domain I bought from GoDaddy, the website was up in a few hours. It is not easy to choose a domain name when my first and last name is such a common name. I wanted something simple and easy to remember, so I went for Rosebery.ca. I don't know if this is a good name. Let's use it for a year, and see if I really need a better name.

This command: jekyll --server --auto --pygments, is really handy to compile everything locally from the terminal, and we get an updated site (posts, layouts). The last step will be to upload all the files that have been turned into HTML to the web server. This can be done with Github or rsync.

To sum up, I was very excited to learn about Jekyll. It is like a small project that I can keep working on even though I encountered some difficulty at first. I wish I had the same enthusiasm for things that I'm supposed to put my energy into. More to come soon :-).

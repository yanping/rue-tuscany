It was nice learning about [github pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages) and [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  I'm still not quite done, but at least we have the basics for now. I have in mind several features to implement, and I hope to tweak the borrowed design further in order to reflect myself better as soon as I get time. The [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) language seems to be a very logical way for writing posts. It is wonderful in a way that it allows us to focus better on the content.

During the process, I tested out this blog with a few different browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer (IE) 8, Chrome, and Opera. Getting it to work with Firefox was not so straightforward. For example, how could a Firefox browser possibly give us an IE 6 warning about missing plugin while the browser is obviously not IE. It was only later that I figured out that it had something to do with the default layout. Including the Google Analytic codes eliminated the warning. I still don't understand because the error message was kind of misleading. I was relieved that it did not take me too long to narrow down to this. It usually takes me more time on similar issues.

This command: jekyll --server --auto --pygments, is really handy to compile everything locally from the terminal, and we get an updated site (posts, layouts). The last step will be to upload all the files that have been turned into HTML to the web server. This can be done with Github or rsync.

Despite the limited time to really understand and take away lessons from Jekyll and Github, I was very excited spending time with them. It is like a small project that I can keep working on even though I encountered some difficulty at first. I wish I had the same enthusiasm for things that I'm supposed to put my energy into. More to come soon :-).

Everyone will be happy if I can be done with my thesis. Needless to say, I will be the happiest if I can live up to my aspirations. I have contemplated using the carrot and stick approach to keep myself going, setting time line for each small task. It hasn't worked quite well because I've always managed to get tied down to some distraction, and another week passes by just like that. It's scary to think about it at times. In his [blog](http://www.happenchance.net/), Seth mentioned that the environment has to be supportive and you need the right trigger for behavioral change. I don't have the first, because I prefer to work from home and I'm saving money for the better things I could easily have at home -- eating out is expensive and the quality is not so good at any universities. I'm not doing what is best, and I miss the time when I could talk to my friends. 

Therefore, I have been figuring out how to minimize noise to my workspace. Listening to music with headphones on is not the good answer all the time, because it can easily turn into another distraction itself. As for the trigger, there could have been so much potential coming from inside the more you reflect about things. My advisor has been wonderful and supportive. I simply haven't pushed myself hard enough as an adult. I think I need to set standards and be strict with them. Furthermore, [fear and guilt-based motivator](http://www.happenchance.net/6-reasons-why-behavior-change-is-hard%E2%80%A6and-how-to-make-it-easier/) will not work. 

My current motivators are: 1) So that I could regain my self confidence by finishing graduate school. 2) I won't ruin the good relationship with my advisor. Wouldn't it be more exciting to possibly stretch those into long term, lasting goals?

While I love the potential use and awesomeness of the things I'm working on, I haven't put my heart and energy 100% in it. When the only goal you have in mind is to graduate, and you don't even know where you will be living next, and whether you will be able to find a job related to your field thereafter, things do not sound so promising. While I'm looking forward to finding out what will be in store for me, I'm afraid to lose the flexibility and freedom I have in graduate school. Perhaps I just need an assurance that I will be working on great things next. Unfortunately, good things seldom come without hard work. There's no shortcut... . I'm still searching for the higher purpose that will stand the test of time to keep me motivated in whatever responsibilities I choose to bear, and I found this inspiring talk from [Dan Pink's talk at the RSA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc). Let me give a short summary of it.

> It is common knowledge that human beings perform their best under the premise of big rewards or incentives. But there's another model known as the 'left wing' or 'socialist' reward that we may not hear much of. Some may consider that as strange economic behavior. When people are assigned tasks that require above rudimentary cognitive skill -- those more than just basic tasks following along a set of algorithmic rules -- which require some conceptual, creative thinking, study shows that higher incentives lead to poorer performances. Why is that so? People are purpose maximizer, and they want to be self-directed; all of us need a sense of purpose. More and more organizations want to have some kind of transcendent purpose. When the profit motive gets unmoored from the purpose motive, bad things happen.

> A lot of people have full time job with limited discretionary time, yet they still find time to volunteer unconditionally. Similary, we see many of those who play instruments just for fun during the weekends. This proves that challenge to mastery makes contribution. Another great example is of the Australian-based software company, Atlassian. One day, the company decided to let its employees to work on anything they love for the next 24 hours -- under the condition that they had to report the result at the end of the day. Unexpectedly, the employees produced great fixes that otherwise will never emerge under normal cicumstances. When we treat people like people, we make a better world.

If you have time, watching the video is much better. I tried to recapture the talk although it's been a few days since I watched it. The 10.38 min video has wonderful illustration and narrative.

excerpt: Perhaps shallow friendships are better than none?

I did not persist until the end. Instead of deleting my Facebook account, I deactivated it after further consideration. Many people have come to rely on Facebook's messaging system as a practical way for easy and fast communications. However, it is not without any downside with regards to the emotional effect it brought along. There is something really wrong with excessive use that has fundamentally twisted our hopes and reality. There are many more important things awaiting us to do in the real world. I didn't regret I gave myself a break from Facebook, and I remind myself that I need not spend too much time on it if I ever reactivate it again, which I just did.

After this experience, and by following closely privacy news surrounding Facebook, we ought to understand the many different viewpoints people have towards Facebook. Unfortunately, the company's stance has not changed very much despite all the complaints and pressures from privacy advocates and regulators. While the founder of Facebook thinks [radical transparency](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html) is good for everyone, the company does not seem to exhibit the same kind of transparency in return.

Meanwhile, [Diaspora](http://joindiaspora.com/) is a social network planned to be built as a better alternative to Facebook. It will be interesting to see how this open and decentralized network can change the game. If there is one thing that has been quite successful to keep me as a user, it will be that we don't know those people in our contact list as much as we thought we did. Once in a while, there will be random nice surprises from people who suddenly decide to get in touch, or those who express their common interest in the stuff we share. It can be felt as a kind of emotional support and warmthness.

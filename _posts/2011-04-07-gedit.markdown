title: Gedit as All Purpose Text Editor and IDE
location: Ottawa, Canada
excerpt: With the lack of time to learn new things, I'll stick with the default Gnome text editor in the mean time.

I had been checking out Emacs. I heard a lot of good things about both Emacs and Vim. I wish I was a quick learner. Due to the time constrain and learning curve, I decided to continue using Gedit for the time being. It doesn't make a tremendeous difference whether I use Gedit or other editors, as long as I get things done. I will definitely try to pick up Emacs again in the near future.

Gedit is quite a decent text editor and IDE in my opinion. The main thing that I really like about gedit is its simplicity and ease of use. It is a default editor that comes with Gnome. I recently reinstalled Latex plugin after upgrading to Ubuntu 10.10. I have also activated a number of plugins such as the Word Completion, Align for columns. I am also using it as a Python IDE. *Code Highlighting, Bracket completion, Class Browser, Embedded Terminal, Python Code Completion, Python Indentation and Better Python Console* are among plugins that may help obtain as much seamless coding experience as possible.

I wrote a simple Python script to make sure plugins were working properly for the first time. At a later time, who knows I needed a random number generator to decide on the mobile carrier since I don't know which plans are suitable for the Nexus S I'm getting next week :-).

Coursework
===========

Master of Computer Science:
+ Started in January 2008
+ Research interests: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Semantic Web, Data Visualization and Privacy

Past research interests include Open Source Technology and  Web Services for Distributed Systems. I have also worked quite a bit with Java on Eclipse (including plugin and rich client application development). As for database programming, I have used SQL with the combination of Hibernate and the Spring framework. I will incrementally add some relevant projects and presentations on this page.

<h1 class="emphnext">Nexus S</h1>

<p>For a long time, I was pretty convinced that I wouldn&#8217;t need a smartphone. I got my iPad 1 in June 2010, and I&#8217;ve been enjoying it ever since. It&#8217;s particularly useful for all my readings. I have been able to gradually reduce paper and ink usage from the use of my laser printer. My 2005 Nokia mobile phone will do the job during emergencies. It was only recently that the mobile plan is starting to get the most out of me. <p>Even though I went with the $10 prepaid plan, I had received telemarketing calls whenever the phone was on. Moreover, they ate up my minutes simply from the incoming calls, resulting in the $10 refill amount became insufficient to make calls sometimes. When I forgot to refill on the expiry date -- which is usually a month later -- I lost my existing balance. This has happened too often, but I was too lazy to look for a better solution. Not to mention the accumulated Fido dollars/rewards are unusable. Perhaps there is a way to block these telemarketing numbers, or there aren't any. Another way out is to get a new activation with Fido again. But I have an option not to stick with Fido, equivalent to not spending my money on a carrier that usually goes together with the Big 3 when there is now an emerging no contract, no hidden fees carriers in Canada. </p></p>

<p>So for more than two weeks now, my old cell phone has 5 cents remaining even though I haven&#8217;t made any outgoing calls since the refill a month ago. I have no one to call, and I haven&#8217;t encountered any difficulty on the road while driving. Although I had been able to live without a mobile phone, things can go unpredictable anytime and I definitely need to bring one with me just in case. I&#8217;ve been considering to use my iPad with the <a href='http://shop.windmobile.ca/ProductCatalog/Handsets/DatastickDetails.aspx?id=Huawei+E583%28WINDCA%29&amp;color=blue'>Windspeed Pocket Hotspot</a>. It&#8217;s a Mifi that can serve as wireless hotspot for up to five other devices including laptop and the iPad. This way, I would then only need to sign up for a (possibly unlimited) data plan without the default talk and text plan.</p>

<p>The plan was to use Skype for taking and receiving calls. It&#8217;s not such an ideal solution, because Canada does not have online Skype number yet, which means that whenever people call me in Ottawa, they will actually call the US number in Ogdensburg, New York, instead of the local number. That will certainly cost more for them, but it may work if it&#8217;s a short phone call and I call them back later. If not for the Android 2.3 Gingerbread platform (means one of the first to get update from Google), cleanliness and the ease of customization in Nexus S, instant camera (to take with me when going for a walk and driving) &#8211; and the size of a smart/mobile phone &#8211; using the combination of Skype, Mifi and iPad is much less expensive.</p>

<p>At the same time, Nexus S was only two weeks away from its official release in Canada. Two weeks later, I&#8217;m really succumbing to temptation. I spent a lot of time debating with myself whether to get one or not. I decided in order to get back to work, I should just get one so I won&#8217;t spend too much time mulling over it. Next time faced with similar dilemma, I have to remind myself to read Psyblog: <a href='http://www.spring.org.uk/2011/04/top-10-self-control-strategies.php'>Top Ten Self-Control Strategies</a>.</p>

<p>When Nexus One was released, I already fell in love with Google phone featuring Android OS, but I managed to resist getting one for myself last year, nor did I rush to get an iPhone 3GS or 4. With the exeception for iPad as an eReader, I was not sold at all with iPhone or iPod touch. But this year is quite different. For some reason, our wireless provider &#8211; Primus Telecommunication &#8211; has been blocking some websites, possibly of UK origin for almost a half year. From experience, it&#8217;s hard to get them fixed it right away because they would waste your time troubleshooting unrelated things. This is unbeliavable. Since I work from home mostly, I need to test out whether the website is really down, or it actually works with other providers. I figured I could do it if I had an alternative internet connection, such as 3G.</p>

<p><img src='/images/nexus_s-side.jpg' alt='alt nexus' /> <p> I went to get my Nexus S yesterday afternoon. It is $25 more expensive at WindMobile, but it is still a decent price. Videotron in Quebec was the first to sell Nexus S in Canada globally. But some people had been getting the phone from Wind the day before. The news was reliable and I took the chance to visit the retailer. They have actually begun selling it even though it was listed as coming soon on their website. I will see if I can have a price adjustment if they reduce the price within the next 14 days to keep up with the competition. I was advised to go with the $45 unstoppable plan, but I didn't. It was a difficult decision. I need to test out if the $10 Social Mobile data add-on works for me. I wish there was an option to eliminate the default voice plan. I currently go with the $15, but I'm sure I'll have a lot of unused minutes :). I was told that if we go with the $20 data add-on, the total cost including voice plan and after taxes will be very close to $45. But I'm still not convinced. $45 after taxes will be more than $50. I just have to see for myself. Within a limited time, I will be able to upgrade if I need to. The total monthly payment is $25 for now. </p></p>
<p>The Google Phone is supposed to be unlocked, but I don't know why they told me I can only unlock it after three months with Wind. I really need someone to confirm this. Koodo Mobile has really an attractive price at $425, $75 less expensive than others. If you go on tab, you only need to pay $275 and put the remaining amount on tab. Simply settle the outstanding balance when leaving and you can keep the phone. The tab plan may be just slightly better than a contract. They may have other ways to make profit. Besides, is the phone going to work with foreign SIM cards if I leave Canada? They had one at Best Buy yesterday, but I couldn't buy the phone outright. Instead, I would need to sign a 3 year contract for new activation with Fido. </p>

<h1 id='update_april_15_2011'>Update: April 15, 2011</h1>

<p>After owning Nexus S for a week, I must say I&#8217;m very happy with it. The Google phone turns out to be unlocked since I was able to get it to work with my old SIM card from FIDO on a 2G/EDGE network (Wind uses the AWS network). The GPS picks up my exact location. It came to my rescue when I drove pass the insurance office. In a few months time, faster processors and 3D phones will become a hype and many probably won&#8217;t talk about Nexus S anymore. Regardless, the features offered by Nexus S are sufficient for my needs. Technology evolves and I have to come to terms with that. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll always be waiting for that perfect phone.</p>

<p>I have installed a bunch of applications including Google Goggles, Nole for light notification, and the Swype keyboard. The default keyboard is very good, but I made a lot of typing mistakes as I haven&#8217;t got used to the touchscreen keyboard. Therefore, the Swype keyboard really helps. It&#8217;s incrediblly responsive and I love the crisp sound it produces as we type. I don&#8217;t mind the plastic feel of Nexus S. It may be less elegant than its predecessor, the Nexus One &#8211; also compared to iPhone, LG, and other HTC phones &#8211; but I can look at it as a benefit that contributes to the light weight and how it fits nicely in my hand.</p>

<p>Skype from the Android market didn&#8217;t work as expected on the newer Gingerbread 2.3.3 OS. It didn&#8217;t let me sign in. I was fortunate to have come across the hacked version of Skype that works over 3G. It would be perfect if only we could have Amazon Appstore available in Canada. Everyday, there is a different free app we can download for that particular day. I&#8217;m still exploring ways to delegate tasks from my iPad and computer to the smartphone. It is like working with three monitors :-). Kindle for Android works great. I also have Dropbox and Evernote installed. How convenient to have any types of data synced across computers and mobile devices.</p>

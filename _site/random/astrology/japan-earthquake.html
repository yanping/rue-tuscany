<h1 class="emphnext">The Tsunami and Earthquake</h1>

<p>My heart goes out to the people of Japan dealing with the aftermath of earthquake and tsunami. May all the life lost can peacefully continue their journey to the next stage. I admire those working at the nuclear plants, and I wish them well. I believe the people of Japan will come out of this with a lot of strength.</p>

<p>For the sake of learning, I have been thinking that we should be able to relate the disaster taking place on March 11, 2011 at 14.46 pm to its corresponding Bazi, ZWDS chart, and Yijing hexagram.</p>

<p><img src='/images/sendai-bazi.png' alt='alt bazi' /></p>

<p><strong>Software credit: <a href='http://www.mybazi.com/plotchart/4p.php'>mybazi.com</a></strong></p>

<p>From the above Bazi chart, each pillar has either the heavenly stem countering the earthly branch, or the other way around. From left to right: the Ji earth in Wei counters the Gui water at the heavenly stem, Yi wood counters the earth in Chou, Xin metal counters the Yi wood in Mao. Moreover, there&#8217;s a repetition (fuyin) between month and year pillar. Although a Fuyin doesn&#8217;t necessarily denote a bad event, it is obvious how bad it was in this instance. The bazi of the event is also extremely Yin. There is no presence of Yang element at all, even at the hidden stems inside the branches. There is Chou-Wei clash that took place between the hour and day pillar, and both involved the same element Ji, a muddy kind of earth or soil. Mao and Wei goat silent-push the Hai pig to form the wood frame, giving more twigs for the Xin metal to cut. There&#8217;s a lot of tension in the air with the additional concern of nuclear radiation. In terms of 10 Gods, all the elements in the bazi appear to be unconventional deities. They tend to be sneaky and love to throw suprises&#8230; Seven Killings are also dominant in the chart. The nature of the disaster is quick and aggresive.</p>

<p>Notice the Ren Wu at conception pillar. With water above fire and countering each other, it is a pillar that denotes explosiveness and sudden changes in outcomes. Since there are different schools of Bazi, I shall stop my Bazi perspective here &#8211; unless it&#8217;s justified to make use of the Wu horse at the conception pillar. If this is indeed the case, we may be able to take harm, destruction, and half bullying punishment into account. But still, we don&#8217;t know which one will have priority over another. Fire is produced when Wu and Wei combined, and we have seen there&#8217;s fire everywhere after the event. The Chou-Wu harm along with the Mao-Wu destruction involving the Eating God are telltale sign that the country&#8217;s performance is affected (in economical sense). In addition to the lost of available properties (indirect wealth), their capacity for generating new wealth will be hindered for a while.</p>

<p>Using the Plum Blossom numerology or Mei Hua Yi Su, the time and date of the event is represented by <strong>Hexagram 51, Zhen</strong>. It is an image of thunder above thunder. There are repeated shocks and tremble, which is what an earthquake is all about. It can be seen as a period of anxiousness, followed by the time to reflect and get in touch with the universe and cosmic forces. The changing line at line 6 brings us to relating Hexagram 21: Fire above thunder. When the law of nature is defied, there&#8217;s payback to enforce the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shock is twining, twining, looking around in terror, terror. To set things right: pitfall. The shock does not reach oneself; it reaches one&#8217;s neighbor, no fault. A marriage brings talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a natural disaster of this scale always has something to teach all of us, just like the big tsunami that happened in Aceh at the end of 2004. There has been so much taken for granted, as well as exploited from whatever the nature can give. In return, we should show some compassion and use the resources wisely &#8211; one of the many ways to prepare for the future even though one is not affected directly by the disaster. Be more realistic, think further ahead, and prepare always for the uncommon and unexpected. It does not look like the recovery and rebuilding process will be an easy one. Hexagram 39 shows obstruction, but with great determination they will overcome it. It is an image of water above mountain, limping. Extraordinary measures are likely to be taken, just like what have been seeing from the nuclear plant workers &#8211; <code>The noble one reverses his being to repair the character</code>. Diligence and persistence will be the key as they can&#8217;t rely merely on external support. The good news is that people of Japan have been helping themselves and taking care of each other. Regardless, I hope that they can still make use of the donation and foreign&#8217;s financial help to speed up the recovery and their citizens can slowly get their life back on track.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, in one of the blogs I followed, the writer has long foreseen that a big earthquake was going to happen. Check out his blog entries on <a href='http://atouchofancientszhouyi.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html'>February 28, 2010</a> and on <a href='http://atouchofancientszhouyi.blogspot.com/2010/05/can-mountain-withstand-shocks.html'>May 5, 2010</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s give another try from Zi Wei Dou Shu perspective <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. First, take a look at the travel palace. Using 4 hua or dynamic flying star, the <strong>travel palace is clashed</strong>. The Bing stem at Self domain flies hua ji to Lian Zhen at the travel domain. Lianzhen the Passion Star is also one of the two major Stars that present the widest difference when it is attached with Huaji the Negative Enhancer 化忌.</p>

<p>The <strong>sickness palace</strong> that gives indication of the state of health and emotional health is best to be left empty. In this palace, there&#8217;s Wen Chang with birth Hua Ji and life palace Hua Ke to Wen Chang. The negative effect of Hua ji, that brings obstructive energy and represents the extreme, is enhanced by the Hua Ke. Not to mention the Xin stem also self Hua Ji. At the health 3 Positions 4 Cardinals (San Fang Si Zheng, abbreviated as SFSZ), this birth Hua Ji meets Lu at parents palace, Quan at siblings place, and Ke at estate palace. These 3 multiplers altogether serve to reinforce the Hua Ji energy.</p>

<p>There is always a relationship between one domain and its sixth domain. Counting counterclockwise, the sixth domain of travel palace falls on the parents palace. Since the <strong>parents palace</strong> is directly opposite the health palace, it represents the exterior health. The Ding stem makes this palace self Hua Ji. In addition, it receives Hua Ji and Hua Ke from the Karma palace which represents the unconscious, indirect wealth. The Karma palace also happens to be the sixth domain of Health palace. It sends Hua Quan power multiplier to the sibling palace. Note that the <strong>sibling palace</strong> is the SFSZ OF both estate and health palace. Tai Yin and Tai Yang at sibling palace is self Hua Ji and Hua Ji again from the spouse palace. Opposite the sibling palace is the friends palace. The Xin stem resides at the friends palace. It also shares the same stem with the health palace. On top of the Hua Ji effect, the absence of major stars at friend palace may indicate the lost of loved ones.</p>

<p>Another sign is Wen Qu self Hua Ji at the estate palace, coupled with Wen Chang birth and self Hua Ji at the health palace (mentioned above). Po Jun at the related wealth palace denotes exhaustion and lost of properties. The impatience character of Tan Lang and unseen Tuo Luo effect are boosted by Hua Lu and Hua Quan received from the Karma palace and Estate palace respectively. Tuo luo is found just across the clashed travel palace. With Tan Lang meeting Huo Xing at life SFSZ, this shows the sudden characteristic of the event.</p>

<p>Finally, we can draw connection to the Tsunami from both Tan Lang and Lian Zhen having the water element. Out of 12 domains, the most problematic domains are the travel and health domains that collectively affect the rest of the domains. As seen above, both parents and sibling domains affect the health domain to a big extent. Health and sibling palace subsequently affect the friends palace, depicting a helpless situation. Most of us will think it is useless to do reverse-engineering to the event that has already happened. But we can still gather the signs and use them to help prepare ourselves better for the future.</p>

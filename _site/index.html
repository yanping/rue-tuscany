    <p>
      Growing up until my journey just before entering post-secondary education, I have to admit that I was not aware of any women in the field of computing who would inspire me. In spite of performing well in nearly all subjects during my school years , with the exception of sports, I had not the slightest inkling of my true passion &#8211; what I wanted to study when applying to university, and and what I would love to do upon graduation. So I went on to major in double degrees in Information Technology and Applied Mathematics. Information Technology was the most...

    <p>
      I was overjoyed when my niece was born last year. We had been waiting for months, and our wish was fulfilled exactly on Sunday, October 10, 2010. She is a 7 month old baby now, and she looks healthy and active. I let my mother and grandmother know about my intention of becoming a godmother for my niece. They quickly laughed it off, explaining the responsibilities I had to bear in that case. Actually, I don&#8217;t think it is such a bad idea, because I am not sure if I will be able to have a family of my own...

    <p>
      Two activities: one at the beginning, one at the end. &#8211; Pema Chodron &#8211; In the morning when you wake up, you reflect on the day ahead and aspire to use it to keep a wide-open heart and mind. At the end of the day, before going to sleep, you think over what you have done. If you fulfilled your aspiration, even once, rejoice in that. If you went against your aspiration, rejoice that you are able to see what you did and are no longer living in ignorance. This way you will be inspired to go forward with increasing...

    <p>
      While I&#8217;m starting to see more ways to save money and eat healthy at the same time, that&#8217;s pretty much the only improvement I made this month. It occurs to me that there are many things I can&#8217;t do right. Things like procrastination is obvious. As soon as I regret it, the endless vicious cycle starts all over again. There are great insights from various sources into why one procrastinates. In my case, I notice the lack of self control, gravitation towards immediate rewards, and I grow tired of solving problems that usually take days. Hence, I&#8217;ve developed a strong...

    <p>
      For a long time, I was pretty convinced that I wouldn&#8217;t need a smartphone. I got my iPad 1 in June 2010, and I&#8217;ve been enjoying it ever since. It&#8217;s particularly useful for all my readings. I have been able to gradually reduce paper and ink usage from the use of my laser printer. My 2005 Nokia mobile phone will do the job during emergencies. It was only recently that the mobile plan is starting to get the most out of me. Even though I went with the $10 prepaid plan, I had received telemarketing calls whenever the phone was...

    <p>
      I had been checking out Emacs. I heard a lot of good things about both Emacs and Vim. I wish I was a quick learner. Due to the time constrain and learning curve, I decided to continue using Gedit for the time being. It doesn&#8217;t make a tremendeous difference whether I use Gedit or other editors, as long as I get things done. I will definitely try to pick up Emacs again in the near future. Gedit is quite a decent text editor and IDE in my opinion. The main thing that I really like about gedit is its simplicity...

    <p>
      My heart goes out to the people of Japan dealing with the aftermath of earthquake and tsunami. May all the life lost can peacefully continue their journey to the next stage. I admire those working at the nuclear plants, and I wish them well. I believe the people of Japan will come out of this with a lot of strength. For the sake of learning, I have been thinking that we should be able to relate the disaster taking place on March 11, 2011 at 14.46 pm to its corresponding Bazi, ZWDS chart, and Yijing hexagram.

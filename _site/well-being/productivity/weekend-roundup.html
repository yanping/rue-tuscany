<h1 class="emphnext">Week 3 Roundup, April</h1>

<p>While I&#8217;m starting to see more ways to save money and eat healthy at the same time, that&#8217;s pretty much the only improvement I made this month. It occurs to me that there are many things I can&#8217;t do right. Things like procrastination is obvious. As soon as I regret it, the endless vicious cycle starts all over again. There are great insights from various sources into why one procrastinates. In my case, I notice the lack of self control, gravitation towards immediate rewards, and I grow tired of solving problems that usually take days. Hence, I&#8217;ve developed a strong aversion to doing things. Not doing is also not the solution, because it will come back to haunt you and you can&#8217;t move on. The worst case that can happen if I keep doing&#8230; is actually not bad at all, or nothing.</p>

<p>So here goes a short note to self and a reminder to keep working on the weak points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimize excessive worries. I have to acknowledge that there&#8217;s no way to please everyone with regards to what I write, tweet, or how I view things. The online world has been nice to me. But I still think too much. I&#8217;m struggling to adjust my expectation, and to focus more doing things for myself and for the people who are willing to accept them.</li>

<li>In light of point 1, it is important to be the original me. This implies creativity in every situation. I haven&#8217;t done that enough with my Tumblr blog, and I&#8217;m slowly changing it.</li>

<li>Things do not have to be big, as long as they are original. The difficulty is that many things build on others, and cultivating the complete understanding without diluting the basic principles is a challenge. For example, a thesis always builds on the previous work. Sometimes you no longer know what you are doing, and you lost the confidence half way.</li>

<li>Write three A4 pages everyday. They can be anything that comes to mind. Think of this routine as a training to think less and do more without reservation, without expectation of being perfect.</li>

<li>Completion is a step closer when the ideas are no longer abstract.</li>

<li>When I was little, my granduncle suggested to dedicate more time to practice specific parts of a piano piece that I was not good at. Until now, there&#8217;s this inherent tendency to avoid the unknowns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technology, Privacy and Analytics:</strong></p>

<p>I find it rather absurd that Apple is suing Samsung for copying their technology. While I love my iPad and I consider it more robust than my Nexus on Android, I can&#8217;t justify their action. Samsung is the supplier of chips Apple has been using on their products. Without Samsung, there would have been no iPhones and iPads that gain so much popularity today. In response to the lawsuit, Samsung is suing Apple on 10 counts for stealing their design. It was argued that <a href='http://www.phandroid.com/2011/04/20/did-apple-really-steal-their-iphone-design-from-samsung-pot-meet-kettle/'>in 2007, both Samsung and Apple released their phones at about the same time</a>. The fact is probably nobody is copying anybody. Apple might have tried to obtain discount from Samsung. I see patents as barrier to new innovations. When a company is getting very succesful in amassing uncritical fans, it&#8217;s easy to feel threatened by competitions. We have a long way to a selfless corporate culture.</p>

<p>In addition to the controversy surrounding Apple, new research found that 3G iPhones and iPad devices store users&#8217; locations in an unencrypted hidden file. Using <a href='http://www.bytemining.com/2011/04/location-tracking-on-android-too/'>different approaches</a>, Google has been doing the same with their Android devices. Both companies are said to be building their location database. This has some privacy implication, however, no harm has been done so far. It is a non-issue if the location data do not fall into the hands of irresponsible parties or anyone with certain motives. <a href='http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/'>iPhone Tracker</a> was created to easily map the locations, and <a href='http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/04/how-to-load-your-iphone-location-data-into-r.html'>location data can be loaded to R</a> for those who would like to do more with them.</p>

<p>On <a href='http://petzoldt.tumblr.com/post/3236488086/statistical-flaws-in-twitter-mood-predicts-the-stock'>Statistical Flaws: &#8216;Twitter Mood Predicts the Stock Market&#8217; paper</a> - the lesson is that we need an objective way to measure the performance of data mining algorithms. When tested on a single data set without validating the model using separate data sets, the prediction ability will be largely exaggerated.</p>

<p>Finally, there is now an <a href='http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-cetera/augmented-reality-app-helps-librarians-keep-the-stacks-sorted-20110421/'>Android application utilizing augmented reality to help locate misplaced library books</a>. An iPhone version is being developed. I&#8217;m fascinated by how similar technology used in Google Goggles can do so much wonder that would be impossible prior to the iPhone era.</p>

<p><strong>Quotes of the week, courtesy of <a href='http://amiquote.tumblr.com/'>Lapidarium</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You’ll find out it’s little savors and little things that count more than big ones. A walk on a spring morning is better than an eighty-mile ride in a hopped-up car, you know why? Because it’s full of flavors, full of a lot of things growing. You’ve time to seek and find. I know, you’re after the broad effect now, I suppose that’s fit and proper. But you got to look at grapes as well as watermelons. You greatly admire skeletons and I like fingerprints; well, and good. Right now such things are bothersome to you, and I wonder if it isn’t because you never learned to use them. If you had your way you’d pass a law to abolish all the little jobs, the little things. But then you’d leave yourselves nothing to do between the big jobs and you’d have a devil of a time thinking up things? Cutting grass and pulling weeds can be a way of life.” — <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury'>Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion_Wine'>Dandelion Wine</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete” — <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller'>Buckminster Fuller</a>, American engineer, author, designer, inventor, and futurist (1895-1983)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“Who knows what I want to do? Who knows what anyone wants to do? How can you be sure about something like that? Isn’t it all a question of brain chemistry, signals going back and forth, electrical energy in the cortex? How do you know whether something is really what you want to do or just some kind of nerve impulse in the brain? Some minor little activity takes place somewhere in this unimportant place in one of the brain hemispheres and suddenly I want to go to Montana or I don’t want to go to Montana.” — <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_DeLillo'>Don DeLillo</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_%28novel%29'>White Noise</a>, cited in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Lehrer'>Jonah Lehrer</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_We_Decide'>How We Decide</a>, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston, NY, 2009, p.9.</p>
